# YodaBot

YodaBot is a demo chatbot for Coheres API made to speak exactly like Yoda from Star Wars.

This Chatbot is **NOT** perfect and can sometimes respond in a non-Yoda like way.

## Setup
This setup requires some Python knowledge (How to run files, etc. not how to write code) and Python already installed and set up on your machine.

1. Download and unpack all files
2. Create a venv (when needed)
3. Install requirements.txt
4. Create a file called api_key.txt in the directory where main.py is located.
5. Put your Cohere API key in the previously created api_key.txt file (You can retrieve yours [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys))

## Usage

You need to run main.py. This program is console-based.

## Examples


**User**: What is the force?

**YodaBot**:  Much to learn about the Force, the wise Jedi Master Yoda did say. The Force is a powerful energy field, central to the Star Wars universe. It is a blend of religion and philosophy, binding all things together through harmony and balance.

Old Jedi Knights wielded the Force for knowledge and to maintain peace throughout the galaxy. Wise they were, and strong with the Force was Skywalker, Anakin. But beware, young Padawan, of the dark side of the Force, for anger and fear can consume those who embrace it fully.

May the Force be with you, always.

**User**: What does it mean when my lightsaber becomes red?

**YodaBot**:  When your lightsaber turns red, much anger and aggression you must be feeling. In the Star Wars universe, the color of a lightsaber is often associated with the nature of the Force users. Those who align with the light side of the Force, like Jedi Knights, typically wield lightsabers that are green or blue, representing peace and harmony. 

In contrast, the Sith Lords, who embrace the dark side of the Force, are associated with the color red. Their lightsabers are often red, a symbol of their connection to the dark side and their willingness to use anger and fear as tools.

Thus, when your typically peaceful lightsaber turns red, it could indicate that you are tapping into negative emotions such as anger. This could be a sign of the potential darkness within you, or a warning to investigate your feelings and find a way to restore balance to the light side of the Force within you.

**User**: What other important things should I know?

**YodaBot**:  Much to learn, the Force and its aspects indeed. Here are some more important aspects of the Force and the Star Wars universe that may be of interest to you:

1. The Light vs. Dark Side of the Force: As you now know, the Force is divided into two sides: the light side and the dark side. The light side is aligned with compassion, self-control, and harmony. It is represented by colors like blue and green. The dark side, on the other hand, is associated with anger, fear, and aggression. It is represented by the color red. Understanding and navigating this balance is crucial for characters within the Star Wars universe. 

2. The Force Bond: In Star Wars, there is a phenomenon known as the Force bond, which is the profound connection that exists between some characters who are strong in the Force. An example is the bond between Luke Skywalker and his father, Darth Vader. When strong connections form between two Force-sensitive individuals, they can sense each other's presence over great distances and even feel physical sensations. 

3. The Jedi Code: The Jedi Order, protectors of the light side of the Force, abide by a code of ethics known as the Jedi Code. Some key tenets include "There is no emotion, there is peace," "There is no ignorance, there is knowledge," and "There is no passion, there is serenity." The Code represents the Jedi's commitment to discipline and neutrality in the pursuit of justice. 

4. The Force wields great power: While the Force can be a source of strength, it is important to remember that with great power comes great responsibility. Many characters learn this lesson the hard way, as it is easy to be tempted by the power of the Force for personal gain, which can lead to a shift to the dark side. 

These are just a few of the many important aspects of the Force and the Star Wars universe. The franchise is vast and multifaceted, with countless insights into the interplay between light and dark, the power of connection and emotion, and the responsibilities that come with possessing great power.
